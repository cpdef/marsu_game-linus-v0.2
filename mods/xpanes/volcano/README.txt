* To form a volcano, travel to a lava cave no lower than y = -256, this mod looks for lava up against a ceiling of stone and therefore 'under pressure', forming a conduit to the surface. Specifically the ABM looks for mese, diamond or gold ore directly above "lava source" or "lava flowing", this makes volcanos rare you may need to visit many lava caves before a conduit forms. To cheat or grow a volcano in a chosen place just place an ore above lava.

* When the conduit forms the co-ordinates are printed to the terminal, the magma will then rise fast towards the surface. ABMs are only active on nearby nodes so you need to stay nearby the conduit and follow it to the surface.

* At the surface the vent then rises slowly, emitting particles: lavabombs and ashcloud. As it rises towards a chosen maximum altitude the vent slowly widens to it's chosen maximum radius. Lava flows cool to obsidian and ash nodes. Lava spreading and cooling on water drops an obsidian or stone pillar to the lakebed to avoid the floating volcano bug.
